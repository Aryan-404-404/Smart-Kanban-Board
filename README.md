# Smart Kanban Board 📝

A fully functional Task Management application built with React and Vite. I built this project to master complex state management and implement Drag-and-Drop functionality from scratch without relying on heavy external libraries.

  - **Read:** View tasks organized by status (Todo, Doing, Done).
  - **Update:** Click to edit task titles in-place.
  - **Delete:** Remove tasks.
